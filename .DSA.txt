General:
ASCII Values of letters
A-Z -> 65 to 90
a-z -> 97 to 122

const auto var_name =(data_type) value; -> to store constant value in a variable
int -> -2^31 to 2^31 -1 
unsigned int -> 0 to 2^32 -1
long -> -2^63 +1 to 2^63 -1

Operators:
% -> need two int operands(any qualifier like long,unsigned)

Array:
data_type arr [size]; (declaring static array) -> Size should not be a variable
std::vector<data_type> array_name (declaring dynamic array)
for example : std::vector<int> arr;
std::vector<vector<int>> arr;
std::vector<int> arr(size,value); -> Size can be variable or constant. Default value is 0 which is assigned to every element.

arr.size()
arr.push_back()
arr.pop_back()
arr.insert(position,freq,value)
arr.end()
arr.begin()
arr.clear()
min({1,2,3}) -> No array variables allowed
max({2,3,4}) -> No array variables allowed
reverse(arr.begin(),arr.end())
count(arr.begin(),arr.end(),element)
accumulate(arr.begin(),arr.end(),start_value_of_sum)



Math:
toupper()
tolower()
isupper()
islower()
isalpha()
isdigit()
max(num1,num2)
min(num1,num2)
sqrt(num1)
pow(base,exp) -> returns double 
gcd(num1,num2)
swap(num1,num2)  -> works for arrays as well
exchange(num,new_value) -> will return old value and replace with new value
abs(num1)
floor(num)
ceil(num)

Techniques:
1. Fast pow
while (exp > 0) {
        if (exp % 2 == 1) {        // if exponent is odd
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        base = (base * base) % mod;       // square the base
        exp /= 2;                  // divide exponent by 2
    }

String:
Strings are dynamic 1-D character arrays
to_string()
stoi()
.substr(start_position,number_of_characters)
string(1,character) -> to convert character to string
.find(char_or_string) -> returns first index where found

stringstream s(text);  ->stores individual words that are seperated by spaces present in the string text
s>>word -> access word
s<<word -> add word


Matrix:
2-D array is an array inside an array

data_type array_name [rows][columns] (declaring 2-d static array)

std::vector<vector<data_type>> arr (declaring 2-d dynamic array)
vector<vector<int>> arr(5,<vector>int(4,0)) -> initializing a 5 row 4 col matrix with 0
Matrix is a 2d static array and is also an application of 2-d dynamic arrays with rows and columns. The size of the array inside the bigger array is constant.
int row =arr.size();
int col=arr[0].size();


Stack:
Stack follow LIFO
stack<data_type> stack_name;
s.push();
s.pop();
s.size();
s.empty();
s.top();


Queue:
Queue follow FIFO
queue <data_type> queue_name;
q.push();
q.pop();  -> pops first element (FIFO)
q.size();
q.empty();
q.back();
q.front();


Recursion is calling a function in the same function. The function will keep calling until a value is returned.  

Binary search is used when the array is monotonic i.e when it is increasing/decreasing. Binary search is better than linear search as it reduces the number of iterations. One disadvantage of binary search is that it might not return the first index where found.
Code(for increasing):

Iterative:
int start=0;
int end = arr.size()-1;
while(start<=end){
       int mid= (start+end)/2;
       if(arr[mid]==key){
         return mid;
       }
       else if(arr[mid]>key){
         end=mid-1;
       }
       else{
         start=mid+1;
       }
}
return -1;

Recursive:
int bin_r(int* a,int l,int h,int key){
if(l==h){
   if(a[l]==key){
    return l;
   }
   else{
    return -1;
   }
}
int mid=(l+h)/2;
if(a[mid]==key){
    return mid;
}
else if(a[mid]>key){
    return bin_r(a,l,mid-1,key);
}
else{
    return bin_r(a,mid+1,h,key);
}
}

Sort STL: sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
Sorting is to arrange the values in increasing/decreasing order
1. Selection sort
Code (for arranging in increasing order):
for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++ ) {
        int minIndex = i;
        
        for(int j = i+1; j<n; j++) {
            
            if(arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) 
                minIndex = j;
            
        }
        swap(arr[minIndex], arr[i]);
    }
As the rounds/iterations of i proceed, the elements are sorted from the left(smallest to largest)

2. Bubble Sort
Code(for arranging in increasing order):
 for(int i = 0; i<n-1; i++) {
           
        for(int j =0; j<(n-1)-i; j++) {
            
            if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
                swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
            }
            
        }
        
}
As the rounds/iterations of i proceed, the elements are sorted from the right(largest to smallest)

3. Insertion Sort
Code(for arranging in increasing order):

for(int i = 1; i<n; i++) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        int j = i-1;
        for(; j>=0; j--) {
            
            if(arr[j] > temp) {
                
                arr[j+1] = arr[j];
            }
            else { 
                break;
            }
            
        }
        
        arr[j+1] = temp;  
    } 

Time Complexity:
For a given algorithm there are 3 types of input:
Worst case -> This input/input size takes the highest number of steps to execute
Best case -> This input/input size takes the least number of steps to execute
Average case -> This is the total number of steps divided by total number of input/input size

Big O Analysis is the relation between the time taken to execute code and the worst case input/input size
It is known as the upper bound of the algorithm. Eg: A ferrari will not take more than 6 sec to complete 100 meters. The maximum time it will take is 6 s.
Big Ω Analysis is the relation between the time taken to execute code and the best case input/input size
It is known as the lower bound of the algorithm. Eg: A ferrari will not take less than 3 sec to complete 100 meters. The minimum time it will take is 3 s.
Big θ Analysis is the relation between the time taken to execute code and average case input/input size

We can know the better algorithm by looking at the big O analysis as an algorithm is better efficient if its better at handling its worst case scenarios
Space Complexity:
It is the relation between the extra space taken (also known as auxiliary space) and the input/input size

O(1) > O(logN) > O(N) > O(NlogN) > O(N^2) > O(N^3) > O(2^N) > O(N!)
